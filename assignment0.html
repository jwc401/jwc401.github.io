<p>
I am taking the class because I'm interested in applications of computer graphics in video games (and because I thought the class sounded interesting). During this class, I hope to learn some techniques to develop computer graphics as well as user interactive graphics. Topics that I would be interested in having discussed would be applying computer graphics in VR and in video games.
