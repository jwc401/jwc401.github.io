<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p>
To be honest, I'm not all too sure as to what I would want to do for a final project. I think I would like to do something involving creating a 3D game based in unity. Currently, I'm thinking of something along the lines of a third person platformer where I could do some experimentation on various obstacles/camera/lighting aspects.
