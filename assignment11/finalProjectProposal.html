<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<p>
For the final project, I intend to create a 3D game in Unity where you would explore an environment by walking around and jumping on structures/objects. This environment would involve an open outdoors area with sunlight and an indoors building where I could manipulate the light sources to come from various points on the walls. It would give me a chance to play around with lighting and environmental perception, and could be something that I could possibly transfer into VR (though that would be a stretch goal that might not be reached by the due date).
